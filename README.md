## Overview

This documentation describes the design, implementation, and technologies used in the **AI Chatbot Application** that answers questions based on the content of uploaded PDF documents. The chatbot leverages advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to extract relevant information from PDFs and respond to user queries effectively.

## Approach to Solving the Problem

The primary goal of this project is to create a **user-friendly interface** that allows users to upload a PDF document and ask questions related to its content. The approach can be broken down into several key steps:

1. **PDF Upload and Processing**
   - Users can upload PDF files through a web interface.
   - The application reads and processes the content of the PDF, splitting it into manageable chunks for analysis.

2. **Vector Database Creation**
   - The text from the PDF is embedded into a vector space using embeddings, allowing for efficient similarity searches.
   - A vector store is created using **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**, enabling fast retrieval of relevant document chunks based on user queries.

3. **Query Handling**
   - When a user submits a question, the application retrieves relevant document chunks from the vector store.
   - A language model (LLM) processes these chunks along with the user's question to generate an appropriate response.

4. **Fallback Logic**
   - If the response generated by the model indicates that it did not understand the question or is out of context, a fallback message is displayed, prompting the user to connect with a live agent.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for backend logic, enabling robust processing and integration of various libraries.
- **Streamlit:** A framework for building interactive web applications, providing an easy-to-use interface for users to upload PDFs and input questions.
- **LangChain:** A library that simplifies managing and orchestrating interactions with language models, facilitating seamless integration of various components.
- **FAISS:** A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, used for handling embeddings and enabling quick retrieval of relevant information from document chunks.
- **Groq API:** Utilized to leverage advanced computational resources for model inference, enhancing performance during query processing.
- **Hugging Face Embeddings:** Employed for generating embeddings from text data, allowing for effective representation of document content in vector space.

## Implementation Details

1. **PDF Upload and Processing**
   - Users can upload PDF files through a file uploader in the Streamlit application. Once uploaded, the application processes the PDF using `PyPDFLoader` from LangChain to extract text content. This text is then split into smaller chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, making it suitable for embedding generation.

2. **Vector Database Creation**
   - The extracted text chunks are converted into embeddings using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`. These embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector store, which allows for efficient similarity searches when answering user queries.

3. **Query Handling**
   - When a user submits a question, the application retrieves relevant document chunks from the FAISS vector store based on the user's input. The retrieved context is then passed to a language model (ChatGroq) along with the user's question to generate an answer.

4. **Fallback Logic**
   - To enhance user experience, fallback logic is implemented to handle cases where the chatbot cannot provide a meaningful response. After generating an answer, the application checks if certain keywords indicating confusion or irrelevance are present in the response. If these keywords are detected (e.g., "I don’t know", "not sure"), a predefined fallback message is displayed: 
     > “Sorry, I didn’t understand your question. Do you want to connect with a live agent?”

## Innovations in the AI Chatbot Project

1. **Dynamic Document Interaction:**
   - The chatbot handles dynamic interactions with documents, allowing users to upload PDFs and ask questions about their content seamlessly.

2. **Integration of Machine Learning for Continuous Improvement:**
   - The chatbot uses machine learning algorithms to continuously learn from user interactions, improving its responses over time.

3. **Multi-modal Data Handling:**
   - By integrating various data sources (text from PDFs), the chatbot provides richer responses and insights compared to traditional text-only chatbots.
